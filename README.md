# Capstone-Recommender-system
What to wear! Finery, a wardrobe operating system, was created to get you organized and styled in the clothes you already own and love. But what if you want to find something new?  What if you don’t have the time to sift through the thousands of articles in person or online to find the perfect outfit? What if you want personalized suggestions delivered right to you?

We set out to solve this problem, and built a recommender system to suggest articles of clothing based on similar user’s wardrobes and taste.
